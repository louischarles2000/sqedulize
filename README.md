# Sqedulize
This is a productivity app for handling normal day tasks and developer tasks.

**What I used**
- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- Firebase

> Firebase is used here for user authentication and as a database

## Default mode (to-do)
The app has a default mode that is basically a to do app :D.
It will have features like;
- [ ] Adding a list
- [ ] Adding tasks to the added list
- [ ] Marking tasks status either **done** or **in progress**

## Developer mode
The app has a mode for developers that help keep track on projects.
Ite will have features like;

- [ ] Adding a new task
- [ ] Adding sub-tasks to the tasks
- [ ] Marking sub-tasks status either **done** or **in progress**
- [ ] Generating commit messages from the sub-tasks
